### Documentation Automated

The pull request introduces several changes to `main.py`:

1. **Removed Imports**: The imports for `openai` and `find_dotenv` have been removed, indicating that the OpenAI API and the dotenv's `find_dotenv` function are no longer being used in the script.

2. **Simplified dotenv Loading**: The `load_dotenv` function is now called directly without using `find_dotenv`. This simplifies the process of loading environment variables.

3. **Removed OpenAI API Setup**: The setup for OpenAI API keys and other related variables has been removed, suggesting that the script no longer interacts with the OpenAI API.

4. **Refined Headers Setup**: The `headers` dictionary is now directly defined with the necessary authorization and accept headers, without the previously included OpenAI-specific setup.

5. **URL Definition Change**: The URL for the GitHub pull requests API is now defined once, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

6. **Streamlined Pull Request Fetching**: The code for fetching pull requests from GitHub has been simplified. The script now directly checks for a successful response and exits early if an error occurs.

7. **Removed Pull Request Processing Logic**: The detailed logic for processing pull requests, including fetching diffs, posting comments, and handling errors, has been removed. This could indicate a shift in how pull requests are being handled or a move to a different part of the application.

8. **Added Exit Points**: The script now includes `exit()` calls after printing error messages, ensuring that the script stops execution if it encounters an error when fetching pull requests or diffs.

9. **Simplified Review Posting**: The process for posting a review comment to GitHub has been simplified. The script now constructs a review comment and attempts to post it, handling success and failure cases.

Overall, the pull request refactors the code to remove dependencies on the OpenAI API, simplifies the loading of environment variables, and streamlines the process of fetching and handling pull requests from GitHub.
