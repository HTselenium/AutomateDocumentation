The pull request introduces several changes to `main.py`:

1. **Removed Imports:**
   - The `openai` import has been removed, indicating that OpenAI's API is no longer being used in this script.
   - The `find_dotenv` function from the `dotenv` package has been removed, simplifying the environment variable loading process.

2. **Environment Variable Loading:**
   - The comment `# Load environment variables` has been added to describe the `load_dotenv()` function call more clearly.

3. **Environment Variable Usage:**
   - The script no longer sets up OpenAI API-related environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_TYPE`, `OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`), suggesting that the script's functionality related to OpenAI has been removed.

4. **Headers Setup:**
   - The headers dictionary is now directly defined without the previously included OpenAI API-related code.

5. **URL Definition:**
   - A new comment `# Define the URL for the pull requests` has been added to clarify the purpose of the `url` variable.

6. **Removed Code Block:**
   - A large block of code that handled the fetching and processing of GitHub pull requests, including interaction with the OpenAI API, has been removed. This includes:
     - Conditional checks for successful HTTP responses.
     - JSON data extraction from the GitHub API response.
     - Logic to determine the last processed pull request number.
     - Fetching and processing the diff of the first pull request.
     - Posting a review comment on GitHub using the OpenAI API.

7. **New Code Block:**
   - A new, simplified block of code has been added to handle GitHub pull requests. This includes:
     - A check for a successful response when getting pull requests.
     - Extraction of JSON data from the GitHub API response.
     - Logic to find the highest pull request number.
     - A check for the existence of a `diff_url` and fetching the diff.
     - Posting a review comment on GitHub without using the OpenAI API.

Overall, the pull request significantly simplifies `main.py` by removing the dependency on the OpenAI API and streamlining the process of fetching and handling GitHub pull requests.
