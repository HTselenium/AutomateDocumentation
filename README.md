**BOT review:** 

The pull request introduces several changes to `main.py`:

1. **Removed Imports:**
   - The `openai` import has been removed, indicating that OpenAI's API is no longer being used in this script.
   - The `find_dotenv` function from the `dotenv` package is no longer imported, suggesting that the environment loading process has been simplified.

2. **Environment Variable Loading:**
   - The comment above `load_dotenv()` has been updated to be more descriptive ("# Load environment variables").

3. **Environment Variable Usage:**
   - The script no longer sets up OpenAI API-related environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_TYPE`, `OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`), which aligns with the removal of the `openai` import.

4. **Headers Configuration:**
   - The `headers` dictionary is now directly defined without the previously included OpenAI API headers, reflecting the removal of the OpenAI API usage.

5. **URL Definition:**
   - A new comment has been added to describe the purpose of the `url` variable ("# Define the URL for the pull requests").

6. **Removed Code Blocks:**
   - A large block of code that handled the retrieval of pull requests, processing of the first pull request's diff, and posting a review comment using OpenAI's API has been removed.

7. **New Code Blocks:**
   - The new code introduces a simplified flow for fetching pull requests, checking for errors, and processing the pull requests without using OpenAI's API.
   - It includes error handling for unsuccessful HTTP requests when fetching pull requests and diffs.
   - The script now prints the number of the last processed pull request.
   - It also includes a new mechanism to post a review comment on GitHub, which now simply posts the diff text without additional analysis from OpenAI's API.

Overall, the pull request refactors the script to remove dependencies on OpenAI's API and simplifies the process of fetching and handling pull requests from GitHub.
