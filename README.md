**GitHub Pull Request Retrieval Documentation**
**Overview**
**This documentation provides a guide on how to retrieve a specific pull request from a GitHub repository. The process involves sending an HTTP GET request to the GitHub API endpoint for pull requests, with proper authorization and targeting a specific pull request by its number.**

**Prerequisites**
Before you can retrieve a pull request, ensure you have the following:

- A GitHub account with access to the repository.
- The owner's username of the repository.
- The repository name.
- The pull request number you wish to retrieve.

Retrieving a Pull Request
### Step 1: Define the URL for the Pull Requests
Combine the user and repo information to form the pull request URL:

url = f'https://api.github.com/repos/{user}/{repo}/pulls/1'

### Step 2: Send the GET Request
Use the requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the GitHub API:

import requests

response = requests.get(url)

### Step 3: Handle the Response
Check if the request was successful and handle the response accordingly:

if response:
    print("GitHub Pull Request is caught")
else:
    print("GitHub Pull Request is not caught:")

If the request is successful, the pull request data will be available in the response as a JSON object. If the request fails, an error message will be printed.

**Conclusion**
This guide provides a step-by-step approach to retrieve a pull request from a GitHub repository using the GitHub API.
