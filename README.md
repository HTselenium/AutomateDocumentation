The pull request introduces several changes to `main.py`:

1. **Removed Imports:**
   - The `openai` import has been removed, indicating that OpenAI's API is no longer being used in this script.
   - The `find_dotenv` function from the `dotenv` package has been removed, simplifying the environment variable loading process.

2. **Environment Variable Loading:**
   - The comment `# Load environment variables` has been added to describe the `load_dotenv()` function call more clearly.

3. **Environment Variable Usage:**
   - The script no longer sets up OpenAI API-related environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_TYPE`, `OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`), suggesting that the script's functionality related to OpenAI has been removed.

4. **Headers Setup:**
   - The headers dictionary is now directly defined without the previously removed OpenAI variables.

5. **URL Definition:**
   - A new comment `# Define the URL for the pull requests` has been added to clarify the purpose of the `url` variable.

6. **Removed Code Blocks:**
   - A large block of code that handled the retrieval and processing of pull requests, including error handling and posting comments to GitHub, has been removed.
   - The script no longer fetches diffs, processes messages for the GPT model, or posts reviews to GitHub.

7. **New Code Blocks:**
   - The new code introduces a simplified process for fetching pull requests from GitHub and handling errors.
   - It includes a check for the `diff_url` and exits if not found, rather than the previous detailed error handling.
   - The script now directly posts a review comment with the diff text to GitHub without processing it through an AI model.

Overall, the pull request significantly simplifies `main.py` by removing the integration with OpenAI's API and streamlining the process of fetching and handling pull requests from GitHub.
