The pull request introduces several changes to `main.py`:

1. **Removed Imports:**
   - The `openai` import has been removed, indicating that OpenAI's API is no longer being used in this script.
   - The `find_dotenv` function from the `dotenv` package is no longer imported, suggesting that the environment loading process has been simplified.

2. **Environment Variable Loading:**
   - The comment above `load_dotenv()` has been updated to be more descriptive ("# Load environment variables").

3. **Environment Variable Usage:**
   - The script no longer sets up OpenAI API-related environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_TYPE`, `OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`). This change aligns with the removal of the `openai` import.

4. **Headers Configuration:**
   - The headers for the API requests are now directly defined without the previously set OpenAI API variables.

5. **URL Definition:**
   - The URL for the pull requests is now defined using the `user` and `repo` variables, which are fetched from the environment variables.

6. **Response Handling:**
   - The previous code for handling the response from the GitHub API, including error checking, processing pull requests, and posting comments, has been removed.

7. **New Response Handling:**
   - The new code introduces a simplified flow for fetching pull requests, checking for errors, and processing the response.
   - It includes error handling for unsuccessful requests and exits the script if no pull requests are found or if there is an error fetching the diff for the first pull request.
   - The script now prints the number of the last processed pull request.
   - It also includes a new mechanism for posting a review comment to GitHub, using the diff from the first pull request.

Overall, the pull request seems to streamline the script by removing dependencies on the OpenAI API and simplifying the process of loading environment variables, fetching pull requests, and posting comments.
