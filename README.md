### Documentation Automated

The pull request introduces several changes to `main.py`:

1. **Removed Imports**: The imports for `openai` and `find_dotenv` have been removed, indicating that the OpenAI API and the dotenv's `find_dotenv` function are no longer being used in the script.

2. **Simplified dotenv Loading**: The `load_dotenv` function is now called directly without using `find_dotenv`. This simplifies the process of loading environment variables.

3. **Removed OpenAI API Setup**: The setup for OpenAI API keys and other related variables has been removed, suggesting that the script no longer interacts with the OpenAI API.

4. **Refined Headers Setup**: The `headers` dictionary is now directly defined with the necessary authorization and accept headers, without the previously included OpenAI-specific setup.

5. **URL Definition Change**: The URL for the GitHub pull requests API is now defined once, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

6. **Streamlined Pull Request Fetching**: The code for fetching pull requests from GitHub has been simplified. The previous logic for processing the response and posting a review comment has been removed.

7. **Error Handling**: The updated code includes error handling for unsuccessful HTTP requests when fetching pull requests and diffs.

8. **Removed Logic for Processing Pull Requests**: The logic for processing pull requests, including fetching diffs, creating messages, and posting comments using the OpenAI API, has been removed.

9. **Simplified Review Posting**: The new code includes a simplified process for posting a review comment to GitHub, without the previous detailed analysis using the OpenAI API.

Overall, the pull request refactors the code by removing dependencies on the OpenAI API, simplifying the loading of environment variables, and streamlining the process of fetching and handling pull requests from GitHub.
