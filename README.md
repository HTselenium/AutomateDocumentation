The pull request introduces several changes to `main.py`:

1. **Removed Imports:**
   - The `openai` import has been removed, indicating that OpenAI's API is no longer being used in this script.
   - The `find_dotenv` function from the `dotenv` package has been removed, simplifying the environment variable loading process.

2. **Environment Variable Loading:**
   - The comment `# Load environment variables` has been added to describe the `load_dotenv()` function call more clearly.

3. **Environment Variable Usage:**
   - The script no longer sets up OpenAI API-related environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_TYPE`, `OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`), which aligns with the removal of the `openai` import.

4. **Headers Configuration:**
   - The `headers` dictionary is now directly defined without the previously included OpenAI API headers, reflecting the script's shift away from using the OpenAI API.

5. **URL Definition:**
   - A new comment `# Define the URL for the pull requests` has been added to clarify the purpose of the `url` variable.

6. **Simplified Pull Request Fetching:**
   - The previous code for fetching and processing pull requests has been removed, including error handling, data processing, and interaction with the OpenAI API.
   - The new code fetches the list of pull requests and exits early if the request fails or if there are no pull requests.

7. **Pull Request Processing:**
   - The script now finds the highest pull request number and prints it.
   - It checks for the existence of a `diff_url` and exits if not found.

8. **Review Posting:**
   - The new code attempts to post a review comment with the diff of the first pull request.
   - It handles the response from the GitHub API, printing success or failure messages accordingly.

Overall, the pull request refactors the script to remove dependencies on the OpenAI API and simplifies the process of fetching and handling pull requests from GitHub.
